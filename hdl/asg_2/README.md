## Exercise 1

The solution to this exercise was done by performing two loops over the
different input vectors, and on each iteration, if there is a 1, a counter
variable is increased (each input vector has its own counter variabe).

The counter variables are then compared, returning the appropriate 2b vector
according to the equality comparison.
